#Word sense disambiguation is a challenging field in natural language processing. 
#There are a number of different approaches to the problem, but currently the most 
#accurate involve supervised methods to train taggers using annotated corpora. 
#A large quantity of annotated data is needed to develop such software due to the 
#complexity of the problem and various contexts in which a given word can occur. 
#As with part of speach tagging, the more data a tagger sees in training, 
#the more accurate it will be when asked to process new data.
