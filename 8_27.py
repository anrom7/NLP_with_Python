#Viktoriia Palianytsia, AL-11, chapter 8, task 27
#In this algorithm, we write the position of words in a triangular matrix which has the form:
#|a11  a12	a13| 
#|0	  a22	a23|
#|0	  0	  a33|
#Vertical axis indicates the starting position of the matrix, and the horizontal axis end position.
# So for us to fill this matrix, we need to multiply the length of the input sentence 3.
