#The dialogue act classifier assigns labels to individual posts, without considering
#the context in which the post is found. However, dialogue acts are highly dependent
#on context, and some sequences of dialogue act are much more likely than
#others. For example, a ynQuestion dialogue act is much more likely to be answered
#by a yanswer than by a greeting. Make use of this fact to build a consecutive classifier
#for labeling dialogue acts. Be sure to consider what features might be useful.
#See the code for the consecutive classifier for part-of-speech tags in Example 6-5
#to get some ideas.
