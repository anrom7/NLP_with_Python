# A production like VP -> V NP | V NP PP has a disjunction on the righthand side,
# shown by the |, and is an abbreviation for the two productions  VP -> V NP and VP -> V NP PP.
# If we parse the sentences that are more than 20 words in length using the
# grammar shown in Example 8-1, we end up with two or more trees.
# Since our grammar licenses two or more trees for these sentences,
# the sentences are said to be structurally ambiguous.
