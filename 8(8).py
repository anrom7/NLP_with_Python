#I have experimented with changing the sentence to be parsed. 
#for one sentence several trees were built. I called a recursive descent parser - nltk.app.rdparser()
#and changed the sentence to be parsed by selecting Edit Text in the Edit menu. But I noticed
#that the changed sentence couldn't be parsed because the Grammar corresponded to a different sentence.
#So, it is necessary to change the grammar that corresponds to my sentence.
