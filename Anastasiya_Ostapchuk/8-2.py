# TODO: How often is "however" used at the start of the sentence?
# Recall Strunk and White's prohibition against using a sentence-initial
# "however" to mean "although".

print "However in meaning of although:"
print """Pullum argues that Strunk and White [StrunkandWhite,1999] were merely insisting that English usage should conform to 'an utterly unimportant minor statistical detail of style concerning adverb placement in the literature they knew' [Pullum, 2005].
This is a case where, a descriptive observation about language use became a prescriptive requirement.
In NLP we usually discard such prescriptions, and use grammar to formalize observations about language as it is used, particularly as it is used in corpora. 
However you look at it, it was a wicked thing to do."""
